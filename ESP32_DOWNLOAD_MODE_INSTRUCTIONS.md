# ESP32 Manual Download Mode Instructions

Follow these steps to put your ESP32 into download mode manually:

1. **Make sure your ESP32 is connected to your computer via USB**

2. **Hold down the BOOT button**
   - This is usually labeled "BOOT" or "IO0" on your ESP32 board

3. **While holding the BOOT button, press and release the RESET button**
   - The RESET button is usually labeled "EN" or "RST"

4. **Release the BOOT button after 1-2 seconds**
   - The ESP32 should now be in download mode

5. **Start the upload process**
   - Run the upload command while the ESP32 is in download mode

Note: If your ESP32 board doesn't have labeled buttons, the BOOT button is typically connected to GPIO0, and the RESET button is connected to the EN (enable) pin.

## Alternative: Automatic Method

We've updated your platformio.ini file to include auto-reset configurations. You can try to upload the code now, and PlatformIO should attempt to automatically put the ESP32 into download mode.

## Other Troubleshooting Tips

If you're still having issues:

1. **Try a different USB cable**
   - Some cables are charge-only and don't support data transfer

2. **Check your USB drivers**
   - Make sure you have the appropriate CP210x or CH340 drivers installed

3. **Try a different USB port**
   - Some USB ports may not provide enough power

4. **Check your board selection**
   - Make sure you have selected the correct ESP32 board type in platformio.ini

5. **Close other serial monitors**
   - Ensure no other program is using the COM4 port
